**Approach:** The approach is quite simple. There are 4 end API end points. The documentation to the same is here. https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29534372/2s9YBxXv89
The database used is MongoDb which is a light-weight database.

**Enhancements:** If given more time the following enhancements could have been made:
    1)  Could have implemented user sign-up and login and store todos based on user id.
    2)  Tested it against more edge cases in postman.

**Challenges faced:**  This was a pretty simple assignment. Just had to check out on making a Postman documentation and it was done.
